## React TypeScript Assessment

Please use the template provided to create an application that satisfies the following requirements:

1. Allows for search of users on github by their username or a partial of their username. 
2. Displays the list of the users that were returned in the search
3. Allows the user to click on a listed user to navigate to a page that displays that user's github activity.
4. Allows the user to view more specific details about an activity item.
5. Has the ability to store and load data from offline storage (Assuming that this feature will be used in future expansions to the application)
6. The application must be responsive for use on multiple devices.

The application template provides a service to call the Github API through Octokit. The structure is there, however you will have to complete the functionality.

Please use the Components, Hooks, Services and Views provided to complete your solution. You may add any extra Components, Hooks, Services or Views as needed.

Creating your own UI components and custom styling will be preferred over using a pre-built UI kit, but is not required.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
